# Project Caelus Encoder PCB

### Project Description

This is a custom PCB we designed for our remote AQI sensing network called BreathTrack. The BreathTrack Network comprises of a central server with several AQI sensors that wirelessly transmit their sensor readings via HTTP through Flask. 

### Why we made it

A Single PCB reduces clutter and wiring issues from our initial prototype. Additionally, we have expanded functionality by adding support for a solar cell, which is accompanied by a Voltage regulator with protection to now allow the use of Lipo Batteries that can be charged through solar power.
